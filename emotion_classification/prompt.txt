You are given a sentence in which a reader describes the emotion they will experience upon reading a book. You are also given a list of 26 emotions categories and typical words used to express each of them.

Your task is to identify the emotion categories that correspond to the reader's emotion that is expressed in the input sentence. If none match, write "Other".
